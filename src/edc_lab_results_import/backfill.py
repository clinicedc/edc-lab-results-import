"""Repair `Result.panel_name` on rows imported before it was written.

`prepare_imported_result` resolved `panel_name` into the dataframe and
then did not persist it, so every result imported before that fix
carries an empty panel. Nothing downstream that joins on panel can work
until this is run: the requisition lookup, the requisition metadata
lookup, and the related-visit fallback in `get_df_result_comparison`.

The panel is a pure lookup from the utest id, the same one the importer
uses, so nothing is guessed here.
